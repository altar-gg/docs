# Privacy Policy
This Altar Privacy Policy (“Policy”) outlines the personal information that Altar. (“Altar”, “we”, “us” or “our”) gathers, how we use that personal information, and the options you have to access, correct, or delete such personal information.

### Our promise
We keep your personal information personal and private. We will not sell or rent your personal information to anyone. We will not share or otherwise disclose your personal information except as necessary to provide our services or as otherwise described in this Policy without first providing you with notice and the opportunity to consent.

Altar’s websites and services are not intended for, nor designed to attract, individuals under the age of eighteen. Altar does not knowingly collect personal information from any person under the age of eighteen.

We also may ask you to submit such personal information if you choose to use interactive features of the websites, including requesting customer support, submitting feedback, or otherwise communicating with us. We will send such communications in accordance with applicable law.

**Material contributed in interactive Areas**: The websites may offer publicly accessible wikis, community forums, comments sections, discussion forums, or other interactive features (“Interactive Areas”).

#### Registered users
**Account Information**: When you register for a Altar account we request your email address. We also ask you to create a username and optionally upload a profile picture. This information is your "Account Information" for the purposes of this Privacy Policy. Account Information is required to identify you as a customer and permit you to access your account(s). By voluntarily providing us with such Account Information, you represent that you are the owner of such personal data or otherwise have the requisite consent to provide it to us.

**Payment information**: We do not require our customers to have payment information on file with us unless they have a paid subscription to our services or other related transactional requirements. When you sign up for one of our paid dervices, you must provide payment and billing information. The information you will need to submit depends on which payment method you choose. For example, if you pay with a credit card, we will collect your card information and billing address, although we do not store full credit card numbers or personal account numbers.

#### hCaptcha
We use the hCaptcha anti-bot service (hereinafter "hCaptcha") on our website. This service is provided by Intuition Machines, Inc., a Delaware US Corporation ("IMI"). hCaptcha is used to check whether the data entered on our website (such as on a login page or contact form) has been entered by a human or by an automated program. To do this, hCaptcha analyzes the behavior of the website or mobile app visitor based on various characteristics. This analysis starts automatically as soon as the website or mobile app visitor enters a part of the website or app with hCaptcha enabled. For the analysis, hCaptcha evaluates various information (e.g. IP address, how long the visitor has been on the website or app, or mouse movements made by the user). The data collected during the analysis will be forwarded to IMI. hCaptcha analysis in the "invisible mode" may take place completely in the background. Website or app visitors are not advised that such an analysis is taking place if the user is not shown a challenge. Data processing is based on Art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR (DSGVO): the website or mobile app operator has a legitimate interest in protecting its site from abusive automated crawling and spam. IMI acts as a "data processor" acting on behalf of its customers as defined under the GDPR, and a "service provider" for the purposes of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). For more information about hCaptcha and IMI's privacy policy and terms of use, please visit the following links: https://hcaptcha.com/privacy/ and https://hcaptcha.com/terms.

### Changes to this policy
This policy was last updated on the date indicated below, but we suggest that you review it from time to time, as our platform and our business may change. As a result, at times it may be necessary for Altar to make changes to this policy. Altar reserves the right to update or modify this policy at any time and from time to time without prior notice. However, if we make changes that we believe will materially impact this policy, or your rights, we will promptly notify you of those changes. Your continued use of the platform after any changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised policy.

**Note that this is not legal advice, and you should consult with counsel in the jurisdictions in which you operate if you have further questions about your specific use case.**
